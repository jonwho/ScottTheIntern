This program is a game written in C# using XNA game studios. In this
repo are the classes my team and I made. We were given around 4 weeks
time to make this game as a final project for our game programming class.

While this game isn't executable because I did not include all the content
folders we made, the classes we wrote worked, and should show insight
into why we made the classes we did and how we used them in the game.
